# RUN_STATE.md - codex-memory

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Workspace root | A:\codex-memory |
| Git repository | yes |
| Branch | main |
| Mode | A4.8 Single-Window 4-Agent Compact Autopilot |
| Current task | CM-0325 / P49 ValidationAggregator P45 posture bridge |
| Current area | P10-observability-admin / static aggregator posture |
| Last pushed baseline | `2b4a956` on `origin/main` |
| Latest runtime safety baseline | `41a5630 fix: add validate memory two phase audit` |
| Last action | Added P49 ValidationAggregator P45 evaluator posture bridge as static report-shape evidence. |
| Last validation | P49 validation passed: changed JS syntax checks; targeted aggregator tests `36/36`; `npm test` `846/846`; `git diff --check`; require/import boundary scan showed only `./constants` in `ValidationAggregatorService.js`. |
| Worktree summary | P49 source/test/fixture/status/board edits are validated and ready for guarded local commit. Local `main` is ahead of `origin/main` by `ed01771`, `056b639`, `9fba356`, and `fa8c414`. No runtime/provider/data/public MCP expansion/durable write/service start/migration-import-export apply/backup/restore/push/tag/release/deploy is authorized. |
| Mainline assumption | `origin/main` is the development base; approval request commit is `1ad3477b0f46eceef55608c0bbd3243c15681f38`; fresh gate target is `7fd17de624c0da76751e863e97302bed0dbec905`. |
| P22 status | Fresh gate refresh passed; security-fix RC artifact created as local Markdown only; tag `p22-rc-7fd17de` created and pushed; GitHub prerelease created; local HTTP MCP deploy/validation evidence chain recorded and closed; production deploy remains blocked pending separate A5 authorization. |
| P23/P24 status | v1.0 Memory Kernel planning baseline through P23.3 are committed locally in `a3b2d77`; P23.4 is committed locally in `0e3e25b`; P23.5 is committed locally in `de64428`; P23.6 is committed locally in `9889378`; P23.7 is committed locally in `82fb28c`; P23.8 is committed locally in `d5f70b7`; P23.9 is committed locally in `0aa02fa`; P23.10 is committed locally in `56bc568`; P23.11 is committed locally in `e9971b8`; P23.12 is committed locally in `54586b8`; P24 validation aggregator implementation plan is committed locally in `a584e4e`; P24.1 fixture shape tests are committed locally in `e79bb1e`; P24.2 minimal aggregator skeleton is committed locally in `8fe5b58`; P24.3 CLI wiring is committed locally in `220ffa6`; P24.4 decision/exit-code semantics is committed locally in `dc6196d`; P24.5 evidence-source map is committed locally in `ca6e3ee`; P24.6/P24.7 rejected report hardening batch is committed locally in `d4f966d`; post-commit checkpoints are committed locally through `a835031` plus this final board-state update. |
| Guarded auto-commit allowed | yes for local commits when scoped and validated; no push is authorized unless explicitly requested |
| Safe-push readiness | no push is authorized unless the user explicitly requests another push |
| Next planned action | Create guarded local P49 commit, then continue to P50 no-touch boundary regression suite if safe. No push unless explicitly requested. |

## Notes

- Project health: strong.
- Governance health: strong.
- Current truth: P36-P45 evidence-first / fixture-only / explicit-input chain plus CM-0320 strict schema/version exact-set hardening is pushed to `origin/main` at `2b4a956`. P46-0 is committed locally at `ed01771`; P46-T1 at `056b639`; P47 at `9fba356`; P48 at `fa8c414`. P49 is validated and pending guarded local commit. v1.0 RC remains `NOT_READY_BLOCKED`.
- Release state: `P34_GOVERNANCE_REVIEW_SURFACE_REPORT_SHAPE_ADDED_RUNTIME_STILL_BLOCKED`; helper output safety is hardened without changing runtime readiness.
- Superseded artifact path: `docs/P22_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_ARTIFACT_806cc847.md`.
- Current user authorization: persistent local A4/A4.8 execution is active for the P46-P50 Evidence Enforcement Bridge goal. Push/tag/release/deploy, provider calls, real memory content read/preview/export/import/scan, diary/SQLite/vector/candidate/recall-audit scans, SQLite migration apply, backup/restore, watchdog/startup install, Codex/Claude config switch, public MCP expansion, `.env`/secret edits, dependency changes, durable writes, runtime mutation implementation, and production deploy remain blocked unless separately explicit.
- Backup creation and restore remain blocked.
- Live HTTP MCP startup, startup/watchdog installation, and HKCU Run edits remain blocked.
- Config mutation for Codex or Claude remains blocked.
- Provider calls remain blocked unless explicitly approved.
- Public MCP tools remain frozen at `record_memory` / `search_memory` / `memory_overview`.
- `validate_memory` remains internal-only.

## 4-Agent Activation Contracts - 2026-05-16

Task ID: CM-0206A
Objective: Worker Alpha performs read-only review of the post-P24.5 Git/board state and identifies the next safest local P24 candidate.
Role: Worker Alpha, read-only explorer.
Risk: A1.
Allowed files: `STATUS.md`; `MAINTENANCE_BACKLOG.md`; `CODEX_MEMORY_NEXT_PHASE_PLAN.md`; `docs/P24_VALIDATION_AGGREGATOR_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`; `.agent_board/TASK_QUEUE.md`; `.agent_board/RUN_STATE.md`; `.agent_board/HANDOFF.md`; `.agent_board/VALIDATION_LOG.md`.
Disallowed files: `.env`; secrets; dependency manifests and lockfiles; runtime data; generated durable data; `src/`; `tests/`; `.github/`; Codex/Claude config; unrelated docs.
Validation: read-only evidence summary; no commands that start services, call providers, mutate data, push, tag, release, or deploy.
Stop conditions: unexpected dirty worktree outside board activation; stale or contradictory board state that cannot be resolved from Git; need for source/runtime/test edits; hard-stop gate; scope expansion.
Expected output: candidate next safe local task, validation scope, and blockers if any.
Handoff: report to Commander in conversation; do not edit files.

Task ID: CM-0206B
Objective: Worker Beta performs read-only review of P24 validation aggregator gaps and validation evidence boundaries.
Role: Worker Beta, read-only explorer.
Risk: A1.
Allowed files: `src/core/ValidationAggregatorService.js`; `src/cli/v1-rc-validation-aggregator.js`; `tests/fixtures/v1-rc-validation-aggregator-v1.json`; `tests/v1-rc-validation-aggregator.test.js`; `tests/v1-rc-validation-aggregator-implementation.test.js`; `tests/v1-rc-validation-aggregator-cli.test.js`; `docs/P24_VALIDATION_AGGREGATOR_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
Disallowed files: `.env`; secrets; dependency manifests and lockfiles; runtime data; generated durable data; `.agent_board` edits; `.github/`; Codex/Claude config; unrelated modules.
Validation: read-only evidence summary; no command requiring provider, service startup, durable data writes, migration/import-export apply, package changes, push, tag, release, or deploy.
Stop conditions: need to change package scripts, public MCP contract, schema/runtime enforcement, live MCP/HTTP refresh, provider execution, migration/import-export apply, durable memory write, or any A5-gated action.
Expected output: P24 aggregator gap summary, recommended next narrow implementation/test slice, and required validation.
Handoff: report to Commander in conversation; do not edit files.

Task ID: CM-0206V
Objective: Read-Only Verifier checks scope, hard-stop compliance, validation evidence, and board freshness for this activation.
Role: Read-Only Verifier.
Risk: A1.
Allowed files: `git status --short`; `git diff --stat`; `git diff`; `.agent_board/RUN_STATE.md`; `.agent_board/TASK_QUEUE.md`; `.agent_board/VALIDATION_LOG.md`; `.agent_board/FILE_LOCKS.md`; `.agent_board/RISK_REGISTER.md`; latest P24 files listed in CM-0206B.
Disallowed files: all edits; staging; commits; pushes; tags; releases; provider calls; service startup; config writes; `.env`; dependency changes; durable data writes.
Validation: read-only verifier checklist.
Stop conditions: any non-board source change in CM-0206; disallowed files changed; hard-stop gate crossed; validation evidence does not match risk level; stale board cannot be reconciled.
Expected output: `PASS`, `NEEDS_FIX`, or `BLOCKED` with scope, validation, hard stops, secrets/dependencies, board state, commit readiness, and required fixes.
Handoff: report to Commander in conversation; do not edit files.

## 4-Agent Activation Result - 2026-05-16

- Worker Alpha: completed. Recommended `P24.6-validation-aggregator-report-shape-hardening-plan`, focused on historical vs fresh evidence, `blocked_pending_a5` vs `planned_not_implemented`, conditional live MCP status, full RC matrix status, and public MCP three-tool freeze.
- Worker Beta: completed. Recommended `P24.6 rejected-flag report contract hardening` touching only `src/cli/v1-rc-validation-aggregator.js` and `tests/v1-rc-validation-aggregator-cli.test.js`; keep exit `1`, no side effects, and preserve stable `safety` / `public_mcp_tools` / `evidence_sources` shape for rejected flag output.
- Read-Only Verifier: `PASS`. Scope remained board-only; no hard stop crossed; no `.env`, dependency, `.github`, runtime data, source/test drift, provider call, service start, push, tag, release, deploy, stage, or commit.
- Commander decision: CM-0206 is closed as board-only activation. No guarded commit requested for CM-0206. Next safe local candidate is the narrow P24.6 rejected-flag report contract hardening slice.
