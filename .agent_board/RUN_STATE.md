## Next Safe Action

CM-1270 makes missing trusted request context fail closed for soft-read request identity: `inferRequestClientId(...)` returns `null` instead of defaulting absent context to Codex. No-context reads can still see shared records, but cannot use default Codex identity to read Codex private records. It does not call providers/MCP, scan real memory, write durable memory/audit outside test fixtures, change config/watchdog/startup, or claim readiness. Next safe action after this local stage is another local-safe Codex/Claude client isolation or runtime-governance source/test slice, or a fresh exact approval path for A5/Red-lane evidence.

## Required Fresh Checks Before Any Branch-Sensitive Action

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -n 10
```

Repository reality overrides this file.
