## Next Safe Action

CM-1374 adds a read-only runtime freshness diagnostic and identifies the current 7605 listener as stale relative to HEAD (`runtime_process_started_before_head`). The live no-token contract failure is therefore routed to runtime freshness/alignment before another F1 rerun. Runtime refresh or service restart requires separate exact approval. Do not proceed to F2/F3/F4/F5 until accepted F1 live evidence exists.

## Required Fresh Checks Before Any Branch-Sensitive Action

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -n 10
```

Repository reality overrides this file.
