## Next Safe Action

CM-1275 adds a test-only regression proving soft-read private visibility uses `requestContext.executionContext.clientId` before conflicting `agentAlias`. It does not change runtime source behavior, call providers/MCP, scan real memory, write durable memory/audit outside test fixtures, change config/watchdog/startup, or claim readiness. Next safe action after this local stage is another local-safe Codex/Claude client isolation or runtime-governance source/test slice, or a fresh exact approval path for A5/Red-lane evidence.

## Required Fresh Checks Before Any Branch-Sensitive Action

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -n 10
```

Repository reality overrides this file.
