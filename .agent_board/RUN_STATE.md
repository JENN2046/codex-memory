## Next Safe Action

CM-1364 restored the default local validation rail by isolating security-profile tests from ambient provider/rerank env and LightMemo CLI tests from shared runtime data locks. Next safe action after this local work is stabilized: regenerate the clean Phase F1 sync packet from fresh facts. Actual push still requires explicit normal non-force push approval, then fresh synced-head A5-GAP-4 approval before bounded F1 live no-write execution.

## Required Fresh Checks Before Any Branch-Sensitive Action

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -n 10
```

Repository reality overrides this file.
