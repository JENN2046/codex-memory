## Next Safe Action

CM-1285 fixes proof-memory retention/tombstone fallback normalization so blank camel-case memory id, lifecycle status, retention policy, validation status, and validation time fields do not mask snake_case fallbacks in design-plan or store-backed dry-run preview paths. It does not call providers/MCP, scan real memory, write durable memory/audit outside test fixtures, change config/watchdog/startup, expand public MCP tools, or claim readiness. Next safe action after this local stage is another local-safe Codex/Claude client isolation or runtime-governance source/test slice, or a fresh exact approval path for A5/Red-lane evidence.

## Required Fresh Checks Before Any Branch-Sensitive Action

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -n 10
```

Repository reality overrides this file.
