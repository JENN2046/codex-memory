## Next Safe Action

CM-1380 prepared the dynamic F3 true-live recall negative-control approval surface. The pre-edit current-facts preflight was ready-not-executed on clean synced `main@171cfb14e70af8665d3349be6e0b02d0f119b7e1`, but the CM-1380 commit will move `HEAD`; after commit/sync, regenerate the exact F3 line from the Phase F snapshot and execute F3 only after the operator sends that fresh line. Do not proceed to F4/F5 until F3 evidence is accepted.

## Required Fresh Checks Before Any Branch-Sensitive Action

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -n 10
```

Repository reality overrides this file.
