## Next Safe Action

CM-1363 adds a read-only local generator for current Phase F1 sync approval packets. The generator prevents stale hand-written push packets by reading fresh Git facts and rendering a non-authorizing `git push origin main` template without executing it. Next safe action after this local work is stabilized: regenerate the clean packet from fresh facts. Actual push still requires explicit normal non-force push approval, then fresh synced-head A5-GAP-4 approval before bounded F1 live no-write execution.

## Required Fresh Checks Before Any Branch-Sensitive Action

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -n 10
```

Repository reality overrides this file.
