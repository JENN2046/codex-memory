## Next Safe Action

CM-1327 fixes review-only governance runtime approval/audit loop packet/audit boolean alias normalization so blank or malformed camelCase booleans do not mask valid snake_case evidence. It does not execute live write/recall, governed actions, read real memory/store/jsonl/raw audit, call providers/MCP, change config/watchdog/startup, expand public MCP, or claim readiness. Targeted governance loop / aggregator tests passed `35/35`; default `npm test` passed `2855/2855`. Next safe action is to commit this validated scope; after that, prepare a separate Red-line/A5 plan before touching real runtime evidence.

## Required Fresh Checks Before Any Branch-Sensitive Action

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -n 10
```

Repository reality overrides this file.
