## Next Safe Action

CM-1257 narrows no-token `memory_overview` selected projection write summary to count-only output. The no-token path no longer returns `latestAcceptedAt` / `latestRejectedAt` activity timestamps while bearer-token full overview remains unchanged. It does not call providers, scan real memory, write durable memory/audit, change config/watchdog/startup, or claim readiness. Next safe action is final default/docs/ledger/diff validation, then commit or otherwise stabilize CM-1257.

## Required Fresh Checks Before Any Branch-Sensitive Action

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -n 10
```

Repository reality overrides this file.
