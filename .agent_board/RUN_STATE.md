## Next Safe Action

CM-1249 implements the minimal SQLite schema startup hard gate: `SqliteShadowStore.ensureReady()` initializes current schema metadata and fail-closes invalid or unknown future schema versions before ordinary runtime tables are initialized. It does not install startup/watchdog, change config, run HTTP MCP, apply migration/import/export/backup/restore, or claim readiness. Next safe action is to commit or otherwise stabilize CM-1249.

## Required Fresh Checks Before Any Branch-Sensitive Action

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -n 10
```

Repository reality overrides this file.
