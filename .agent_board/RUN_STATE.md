## Next Safe Action

CM-1383 executed the exact-approved F4 minimal personal dogfood write on clean synced `main@13a3a313e99611b31ba671fadb63e0f61797b5aa`. Next safe action is local evidence validation and guarded commit if conditions pass. F5 closeout remains the next phase; do not execute additional memory tools, provider calls, remote actions, or readiness/reliability claims without separate scope.

## Required Fresh Checks Before Any Branch-Sensitive Action

Repository reality overrides this file.
