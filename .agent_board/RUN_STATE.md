## Next Safe Action

CM-1215 executed the exact-approved A5-GAP-1 no-durable-write governance loop proof at `main@7d66d072ccb7828770cdb1ddffb5b756152b9af3`. The sanitized in-memory loop input was accepted; status is `GOVERNANCE_RUNTIME_APPROVAL_AUDIT_LOOP_ACCEPTED_NOT_EXECUTED_NOT_READY`, all six stages were `evaluated_not_executed`, and every side-effect counter was zero. No governed action, durable audit/memory write, MCP `tools/call`, provider call, real-memory scan, public MCP expansion, remote write, or readiness claim occurred. Next safe action is to validate and commit CM-1215 evidence.

## Required Fresh Checks Before Any Branch-Sensitive Action

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -n 10
```

Repository reality overrides this file.
