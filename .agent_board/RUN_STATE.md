## Next Safe Action

CM-1323 fixes validate/tombstone lifecycle mutation committed/cancelled audit phase metadata preservation so rollback/review consumers can rely on `previous_snapshot_ref`, `reason`, `evidence`, `reversible`, and `created_at` across pending, committed, and cancelled phases. It does not execute live write/recall, read real memory/store/jsonl, call providers/MCP, change config/watchdog/startup, expand public MCP, or claim readiness. Targeted lifecycle mutation/audit tests passed `74/74`; default `npm test` passed `2852/2852`. Next safe action is to verify fresh Git state; if CM-1323 is already committed, continue to the next runtime gap, otherwise commit the validated scope.

## Required Fresh Checks Before Any Branch-Sensitive Action

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -n 10
```

Repository reality overrides this file.
