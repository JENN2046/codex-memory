## Next Safe Action

CM-1382 prepares the dynamic F4 minimal personal dogfood write approval surface after CM-1381 was committed and synced at `main@e564b5c67093f93657ecf3a8841d9daf2ec90051`. Next safe action is local validation and guarded commit if conditions pass. F4 execution still requires a separate exact operator approval line from a fresh synced snapshot; do not execute `record_memory` before that approval.

## Required Fresh Checks Before Any Branch-Sensitive Action

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline --decorate -n 10
```

Repository reality overrides this file.
