# HANDOFF.md — codex-memory

## Goal

Polish Phase E P2-2 provider benchmark documentation with a reusable record template and clearer retention/interpretation guidance.

## Safe State

Runtime code is not being changed. The active worktree changes are docs-only P2-2 provider benchmark guidance plus `.agent_board` updates. The prior `f40a6f6` push-after gate note remains aggregated locally; checkpoint-20 was not created.

## Workspace / Branch

- Workspace: A:\codex-memory
- Branch: main
- Worktree: P2-2 docs/template plus `.agent_board` changes present locally; no checkpoint-20 file created

## Queue Summary

- done: P1-3 DeepMemo keyword-alias cases committed as `56c647a` and pushed to `origin/main`; checkpoint-18 docs committed as `000c149`; checkpoint-19 baseline committed as `8e3ae8d`; provider benchmark docs committed as `ba7031a`; provider reports index committed as `f40a6f6` and pushed to `origin/main`; push-after gate passed; P2-2 provider benchmark record template added locally
- in_progress: guarded local aggregate commit preparation
- blocked: none
- remaining: create guarded local aggregate commit if final diff inspection is clean; push requires explicit remote authorization

## Changed Files

- `.agent_board/*.md`
- `PHASE_E_BACKLOG.md`
- `PHASE_E_PROVIDER_BENCHMARK.md`
- `benchmarks/reports/README.md`
- `logs/phase-e-provider-benchmark-record-template.md`

## Validation Evidence

- npm test: passed (`123/123`)
- gate:mainline: passed after `56c647a` push
- gate:mainline:strict: not run
- compare harness test: `14/14`
- rollback harness test: `11/11`
- active CLI diagnostics test: `17/17`
- compare suite: latest known `39/39 matched`
- rollback suite: latest known `39/39 rollback-ready`
- input-validation compare/rollback: latest known `5/5`
- agent-selection compare/rollback: latest known `8/8`
- git diff --check: passed
- push-after gate: latest pushed checkpoint `000c149` passed; this local batch is not pushed
- push-after gate: passed after `56c647a`
- push-after gate: passed after `000c149`
- push-after gate: passed after `8e3ae8d`: health `200`, compare `39/39 matched`, rollback `39/39 rollback-ready`
- push-after gate: passed after `ba7031a`: health `200`, compare `39/39 matched`, rollback `39/39 rollback-ready`
- push-after gate: passed after `f40a6f6`: health `200`, compare `39/39 matched`, rollback `39/39 rollback-ready`
- provider benchmark docs validation: `git diff --check` passed with CRLF warnings only; package script references exist
- provider reports index validation: `git diff --check` passed with CRLF warnings only; report links present; secret scan only found placeholder/safety text
- provider record template validation: `git diff --check` passed with CRLF warnings only; trailing whitespace scan passed; local link target check passed; package script reference check passed; high-confidence secret pattern scan passed
- observe:http: not run
- profile gate: not run
- provider smoke: not run
- provider benchmark: not run

## Runtime Notes

- MCP mode: HTTP mainline assumption, verify before runtime claims
- HTTP health: latest known `200` from gate
- Rollback readiness: latest known `39/39 rollback-ready`
- Audit impact: none expected
- Recall impact: none expected

## Blockers

- none

## Decisions

- Keep the `f40a6f6` push-after result as a board-only delayed note.
- Do not create checkpoint-20 unless a later batch needs a formal checkpoint.
- Treat provider benchmark records as sanitized evidence for provider/profile comparison, not as a replacement for compare / rollback / mainline gate.
- Do not push without explicit user approval.

## Next Safe Task

Create a guarded local aggregate commit for the docs-only P2-2 batch. Do not push without explicit remote authorization.

## Warnings

- Verify repository reality before trusting this handoff.
- Do not push without explicit approval.
- Do not apply rollback config patches without explicit approval.
- Do not run profile confirm/apply without explicit approval.
