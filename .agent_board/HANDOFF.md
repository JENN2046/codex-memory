# HANDOFF.md - codex-memory

## Goal

Execute P51-P62 Runtime-Enforced Governed Memory Spine Completion under local A4/A4.8 boundaries.

## Workspace

`A:\codex-memory`

## Branch

`main`

## Worktree

Worktree is clean immediately after local commit `6f29757 feat: add p57 recall isolation proof helper`. `origin/main = 1ae4286 test: harden no-touch redaction regressions`; local `main` is ahead by 29 commits. Push is not authorized.

## Current Area

P8 memory-governance / P57 recall isolation runtime proof explicit-input evaluator.

## Current Truth

- P46-P50 Evidence Enforcement Bridge is pushed to `origin/main` at `1ae4286`.
- P51-T1 through P56-T1 are locally committed through `a31ff3a`.
- P56-T2 governance loop explicit-input helper is implemented, validated, and committed locally in `f69fbbb`; post-commit board reconciliation is committed locally in `12e6666`.
- P57-T1 recall isolation runtime proof boundary inventory is implemented, validated, and committed locally in `c89a772`; post-commit board reconciliation is committed locally in `19ad34b`.
- P57-T2 recall isolation runtime proof explicit-input evaluator is implemented, validated, and committed locally in `6f29757`.
- v1.0 RC remains `NOT_READY_BLOCKED`.
- P57-T2 is not recall isolation runtime proof execution, contamination report readiness, final RC readiness, or v1 RC readiness.

## Validation

- P57-T1 validation passed: new test syntax, fixture JSON parse, targeted P57 test `13/13`, targeted P38/P43/P55/P57 set `49/49`, `npm test` `963/963`.
- P57-T2 validation passed: changed JS syntax checks, targeted helper/no-touch test `10/10`, targeted P38/P43/P55/P56/P57 set `61/61`, boundary scan returned no hits, `npm test` `969/969`.

## Hard Stops

No push, tag, release, deploy, provider/model call, real memory content read/preview/export/import/scan, diary/SQLite/vector/candidate/recall-audit scan, SQLite migration apply, backup/restore, service/watchdog/startup install, Codex/Claude config switch, public MCP expansion, `.env`/secret edit, dependency change, durable memory/audit write, runtime mutation, or production deploy is authorized unless separately explicit.

## Next Safe Step

Finish the P57-T2 post-commit board reconciliation commit. After that, the next safe candidate is P58-T1 migration/import-export/backup-restore approval framework boundary inventory. Do not push unless explicitly authorized.
