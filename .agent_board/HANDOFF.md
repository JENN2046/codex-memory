Current facts snapshot: `.agent_board/CURRENT_FACTS.json`.

Current task: `CM-1469 controlled mutation public registration approval packet`.
Current validation: `CMV-1575`.
Current handoff: CM-1469 prepared the exact approval packet for future validate/tombstone/supersede public registration without registering public MCP tools; future implementation remains exact-approval / Red-boundary work.

## Active Handoff

Goal: implement the next local-safe hardening plan through bounded source/test and docs/contract slices.

Current status: `COMPLETED_VALIDATED_CONTROLLED_MUTATION_PUBLIC_REGISTRATION_APPROVAL_PACKET_NO_REGISTRATION`.

Workspace: `A:\codex-memory`.

Current entrypoints:

- `CURRENT_STATE.md`
- `.agent_board/CURRENT_FACTS.json`
- `.agent_board/TASK_QUEUE.md`
- `.agent_board/VALIDATION_LOG.md`
- `CURRENT_STATE.md`

Completed in this slice:

- CM-1461 registered readonly bounded `audit_memory` in public MCP `TOOL_DEFINITIONS` and `app.callTool(...)` under exact approval.
- CM-1469 prepared the controlled mutation public registration approval packet without registering public MCP tools.
- CM-1468 added controlled mutation public contract preflight source/test without registration.
- CM-1460 added readonly bounded `AuditMemoryReadonlyService`, service tests, public-contract preflight tests, and approval packet without public registration.
- CM-1459 added guarded lifecycle SQLite migrate CLI, local release gate scripts, and `audit_memory` approval packet reinforcement.
- CM-1450 tightened no-token loopback warning wording without startup mutation.
- CM-1451 added independent health `policyGates` low-disclosure contract coverage.
- CM-1452 bridged the release gate matrix to default-safe runner exclusions without package script changes.
- CM-1453 reinforced readonly `audit_memory` draft validation against mutation-like inputs without public MCP registration.
- CM-1454 selected no further automatic local-safe slice.
- Recorded CM-1450 through CM-1469 and CMV-1560 through CMV-1575 in `.agent_board`.
- The only public MCP expansion in this slice is the exact-approved readonly bounded `audit_memory` registration. No live runtime, live memory tool call, bearer-token material use, provider/API call, true memory read/write, raw store scan, durable memory/audit write, config/watchdog/startup mutation, remote action, readiness claim, or `RC_READY` claim occurred.

Validation: latest `CMV-1575`; CM-1469 required docs/board/status and broader validation recorded in `.agent_board/VALIDATION_LOG.md`.

Boundaries:

- No runtime action, live memory tool call, provider/API call, token use, raw store scan, memoryId lookup, raw response print/persist, real durable memory/audit write, config/watchdog/startup change, public MCP expansion, remote action, or readiness claim in CM-1444.

Next safe action:

Future controlled mutation public registration, confirmed mutation, real DB apply, live/runtime/memory/provider/bearer/raw/remote/readiness work requires fresh exact approval.

## Historical Handoff Archive

Long historical handoff text was compressed by `CM-1420`.

Use:

- `docs/archive/CM1420_CONTEXT_SURFACE_COMPRESSION_INDEX.md`
- Git history before the CM-1420 change
- targeted evidence docs named by task id

Do not paste full historical handoff text into default context unless the current decision requires exact wording.
