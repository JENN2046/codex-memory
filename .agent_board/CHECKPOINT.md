## Active Boundaries

- No real memory content read, preview, export, import, or scan.
- No diary, SQLite, vector, candidate cache, or recall-audit scan.
- No provider/model call.
- No service/watchdog/startup install.
- No Codex/Claude config switch.
- No public MCP expansion.
- No `.env` or secret edit.
- No dependency change.
- No durable memory/audit write or runtime mutation.
- No SQLite migration apply, import/export apply, backup/restore apply.

## P63-T1 Evidence

- Added `src/core/FinalRcRuntimeEvidenceRunner.js`.
- Added `src/cli/final-rc-matrix-runner.js`.
- Added `tests/final-rc-runtime-evidence-runner.test.js`.
- Added `docs/P63_FINAL_RC_RUNTIME_EVIDENCE_BRIDGE.md`.
- Added `logs/p63-final-rc-runtime-evidence-report-01.md`.
- Real runner execution passed 11/11 critical gates, including `gate:ci` and `gate:mainline:strict`.
- ValidationAggregator accepted 11 sanitized local validation evidence inputs and still returned `NOT_READY_BLOCKED`.
- This locally evidences `final_rc_matrix_runner_not_executed_as_real_matrix`, but keeps runtime readiness, final RC readiness, v1 RC readiness, cutover, and `RC_READY` blocked.

## P64-T1 Evidence

- Added schema/version metadata rejection to `src/core/MemoryWriteService.js`.
- Extended `tests/schema-version-runtime-boundary.test.js` to prove direct core write-boundary rejection before diary persistence.
- Updated `src/core/ValidationAggregatorService.js` and related aggregator fixtures/tests so schema/version runtime enforcement reports `runtime_write_boundary_guard_added`.
- Updated `src/core/FinalRcRuntimeEvidenceRunner.js` so the final runner matrix includes the schema runtime boundary test.
- Added `docs/P64_RUNTIME_SCHEMA_VERSION_WRITE_BOUNDARY_EVIDENCE.md`.
- Added `logs/p64-runtime-schema-version-write-boundary-evidence-report-01.md`.
- Real runner execution passed 12/12 critical gates at `2026-05-18T03:59:06.834Z`.
- This locally evidences `runtime_schema_version_enforcement_not_fully_proven` and `final_rc_matrix_runner_not_executed_as_real_matrix`, but keeps final RC readiness, v1 RC readiness, cutover, and `RC_READY` blocked.

## Next Safe Step

P65-T1 is complete, validated, and committed locally in `04ae047` as a stricter ValidationAggregator slice. It adds explicit sanitized runtime evidence summary ingestion only; the aggregator still does not execute gates, read files, start services, call providers, scan real memory/runtime stores, mutate durable state, expand public MCP, or claim runtime/final-RC/v1-RC readiness.

P65.1 is complete and validated locally as a runner semantics hardening slice. Local allowlisted command execution is now represented by `localRuntimeEvidenceMatrixExecuted` and `allowlistedFinalRcEvidenceRunnerExecuted`; `finalRcMatrixExecuted=false` and `fullFinalRcMatrixExecuted=false` remain blocked, and sanitized runtime evidence summaries reject full-matrix execution/readiness claims so reports cannot be misread as full Final RC matrix completion.

P65.2 push readiness approval request is drafted as docs/board only. Local payload head is `066a35d`; origin/remote main is `8905939`; approval remains `NOT_APPROVED`; decision remains `BLOCKED_HARD_STOP`; no push was executed.

P66 remaining runtime gap inventory refresh is drafted as docs/board only. P63/P64 locally evidenced 2 runtime gaps; 7 runtime gaps remain open; 16 A5 hard stops remain blocked. v1.0 RC remains `NOT_READY_BLOCKED`.

P66.1 ValidationAggregator full-implementation definition is added as docs/fixture/test only. It defines required criteria, fail-closed cases, forbidden claims, seven remaining runtime gaps, and sixteen A5 hard stops before `validationAggregatorFullImplementation` can ever become true.

P66.2 ValidationAggregator definition static bridge is implemented locally. It exposes the P66.1 definition as static, non-authoritative report-shape evidence only: no fixture read, no helper/test/gate/runner execution, no service start, no real memory/runtime-store scan, no provider call, no durable write, no public MCP expansion, and no runtime/final-RC/v1-RC readiness claim.

P66.3 ValidationAggregator runtime gap plan is added as docs/fixture/test only. It locks the seven remaining runtime gaps in priority order, keeps high-risk runtime proof gaps behind A5 authorization, and preserves the public MCP freeze, internal-only `validate_memory`, all A5 hard stops, and `NOT_READY_BLOCKED`.

P66.4 ValidationAggregator gap priority fixture tests are added as docs/fixture/test only. They lock the first remaining gap's acceptance criteria, required evidence groups, disallowed work, fail-closed cases, and forbidden readiness claims. The selected gap remains open.

P66.5 ValidationAggregator source registry proof helper is added as pure explicit-input code. It accepts only caller-provided source registry objects, enforces the exact source set, fails closed for source/public-MCP/readiness/no-touch drift, and performs no file read, command execution, service start, provider call, real memory scan, durable write, public MCP expansion, or readiness claim.

P66.6 ValidationAggregator source registry static bridge is added to the report shape. It exposes P66.5 helper capability without importing or executing the helper and keeps all readiness flags false.

P66.7 ValidationAggregator source registry closeout records the source-registry proof slice as locally closed and selects `evidence_freshness_proof` as the next local-safe evidence group. The overall `validation_aggregator_full_implementation_incomplete` gap remains open.

P66.8 ValidationAggregator evidence freshness proof fixture defines explicit freshness fields, UTC timestamp rules, baseline binding, freshness window policy, low-risk summary restrictions, and fail-closed cases. It does not read real evidence files or execute runtime collection.

P66.9 ValidationAggregator evidence freshness proof helper adds pure explicit-input evaluation for caller-provided freshness evidence. It does not read files, execute commands, start services, call providers, scan real memory/runtime stores, write durable state, expand public MCP, or claim readiness.

P66.10 ValidationAggregator evidence freshness static bridge exposes the P66.9 helper capability as static report evidence only. It does not import or execute the helper and keeps all readiness flags false.

P66.11 ValidationAggregator evidence freshness closeout records the evidence freshness proof slice as locally closed and selects `baseline_binding_proof` as the next local-safe evidence group. The overall `validation_aggregator_full_implementation_incomplete` gap remains open.

Stop before any push/tag/release/deploy/config/watchdog/cutover/runtime-execution/RC_READY boundary unless explicitly authorized. Treat `CMD-0012`, `CMB-0005`, and `RR-0004` as controlling records for any resume that might otherwise treat local runner evidence as final RC or RC readiness.
