# CHECKPOINT.md - codex-memory

## Current Goal

Draft the P22 post-artifact operator handoff without performing tag, release, or deploy.

## Current Area

P22 post-artifact operator handoff

## Current Status

- `main`, local `origin/main`, and remote `refs/heads/main` were at `6db7c540207f6b32a8ae9d84b413a72683b4fbd7` before this P22.13 batch.
- P22 planning is closed.
- Approved local non-provider RC gate refresh execution completed and is recorded as `PASS`.
- P22.5 artifact approval request, P22.6 manifest shape, P22.7 notes draft, and P22.8 operator handoff are complete.
- Release state is now `RC_ARTIFACT_CREATED_TAG_RELEASE_DEPLOY_NOT_PERFORMED`.
- Current work is only `P22.13-post-artifact-operator-handoff`.

## Completed Work In This Batch

- Added [P22_POST_ARTIFACT_OPERATOR_HANDOFF.md](/A:/codex-memory/docs/P22_POST_ARTIFACT_OPERATOR_HANDOFF.md).
- Recorded artifact path, gate evidence, done/not-done, next approval options, rollback path, troubleshooting notes, release warning, and exact forbidden actions.
- Confirmed no tag, release, deploy, provider call, config mutation, startup/watchdog operation, live HTTP MCP startup, real memory preview, migration/import-export apply, public MCP expansion, package/lockfile change, `.env`/secret change, or durable DB/memory write.

## Changed Files

- `docs/P22_POST_ARTIFACT_OPERATOR_HANDOFF.md`
- `CODEX_MEMORY_NEXT_PHASE_PLAN.md`
- `MAINTENANCE_BACKLOG.md`
- `STATUS.md`
- `.agent_board/CHECKPOINT.md`
- `.agent_board/HANDOFF.md`
- `.agent_board/RUN_STATE.md`
- `.agent_board/TASK_QUEUE.md`
- `.agent_board/VALIDATION_LOG.md`

## Validation

- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\validate-local.ps1 -Area docs`: passed.

## Not Done

- No RC gate executed.
- No gates rerun in this phase.
- No `npm test` rerun in this phase.
- No `gate:ci` rerun in this phase.
- No compare / rollback gate rerun in this phase.
- No worktree created in this phase.
- No live HTTP MCP startup.
- No service start.
- No watchdog start or install.
- No scheduled task install.
- No HKCU Run edit.
- No Codex / Claude config mutation.
- No provider smoke or provider benchmark.
- No real memory preview.
- No durable DB or memory write.
- No SQLite migration or `ALTER TABLE`.
- No import/export apply.
- No public MCP schema/tool change.
- No package or lockfile change.
- No release candidate artifact creation.
- No tag, release, or deploy.

## Next Safe Action

Run guarded commit, safe-push if ready, then continue to `P22.x-rc-artifact-readiness-closeout`. Do not tag, release, deploy, call providers, mutate config, start services, preview real memory, write durable memory, migrate/import-export apply, expand MCP, change package/lockfile, or edit `.env` / secrets without separate explicit approval.
