## CM-1438 Auth Preflight Envelope Clarification

Status: `COMPLETED_VALIDATED_DOCS_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_CLARIFICATION_NOT_EXECUTED`

Scope:

```text
docs/source-of-truth clarification; no live execution
```

Recorded:

- Clarification path: `docs/CM1438_AUTHENTICATED_MCP_PREFLIGHT_ENVELOPE_CLARIFICATION.md`.
- Updated packet: `docs/CM1436_SCOPED_WRITE_FOLLOW_UP_SEARCH_VALIDATION_SCOPE_PACKET.md`.
- CM-1437 classified as `SEARCH_SHAPE_PASSED_BUT_BOUNDARY_DEVIATED`.
- CM-1437 sanitized shape evidence was positive: exactly one `search_memory`, `resultCount=1`, `resultsLength=1`, `access.mode=authenticated_bounded_search`, forbidden key paths `0`, no raw/id/path/title/snippet leakage.
- Deviation reason: bearer token was used for authenticated MCP `initialize` session setup, while the approval wording allowed bearer token only for the one `search_memory` call.
- Future authenticated MCP approvals may explicitly allow bearer token use for authenticated `initialize` session setup, authenticated `tools/list` if required, and the exactly approved `tools/call`.
- Extra tool calls, extra search, broad reads, raw response output/persistence, provider/API, raw store scan, memoryId lookup, and readiness / `RC_READY` claims remain forbidden unless separately and exactly approved.
- No live `search_memory`, `record_memory`, `memory_overview`, bearer-token use, provider/API, true memory read/write, raw store scan, memoryId lookup, raw response print/persist, runtime action, public MCP expansion, remote action, or readiness / `RC_READY` claim occurred in CM-1438.

Boundary:

- No new live probe in CM-1438.
- No `record_memory`.
- No `search_memory`.
- No `memory_overview`.
- No provider/API call.
- No bearer-token use in CM-1438.
- No raw memory/audit/store scan.
- No memoryId lookup.
- No raw response print or persistence.
- No durable memory/audit write.
- No config/watchdog/startup change.
- No public MCP expansion.
- No remote action.
- No readiness, reliability, release, cutover, or `RC_READY` claim.

Validation: `CMV-1548` docs/source-of-truth validation.
