## CM-1444 Phase H Local-Safe Space Exhaustion Route Selection

Status: `COMPLETED_VALIDATED_SCOPE_SELECTION_NO_LOCAL_SAFE_SOURCE_TEST_REMAINS`

Scope:

```text
docs/board route selection only; no source/runtime execution
```

Recorded:

- Added `docs/CM1444_PHASE_H_LOCAL_SAFE_SPACE_EXHAUSTION_ROUTE_SELECTION.md`.
- Reviewed active queue, current state, Phase H route docs, `CM-1442`, and `CM-1443`.
- Confirmed `CM-1443` consumed the last selected local-safe Phase H source/test candidate.
- Confirmed active `CM-1422` remains exact bounded live `search_memory`, not default local-safe source/test work.
- Selected no new local-safe Phase H source/test slice.
- No runtime action, memory tool call, bearer-token use, provider/API call, true memory read/write, raw store scan, durable write, config/watchdog/startup change, public MCP expansion, remote action, readiness claim, or `RC_READY` claim occurred.

Validation: `CMV-1554` docs/board route validation.

Next safe action:

- Optional guarded local commit if separately requested and eligible.

## CM-1440 Phase H Next Local-Safe Slice Selection

Status: `COMPLETED_VALIDATED_SCOPE_SELECTION_NOT_EXECUTED`

Scope:

## CM-1439 Post-Fast-Forward Local Health Validation

Status: `COMPLETED_VALIDATED_POST_FAST_FORWARD_LOCAL_HEALTH`

Scope:

```text
post-fast-forward local health validation; no source/runtime change
```

Recorded:

- Local `main` was fast-forwarded to `origin/main` at short head `f0bcdf5`.
- Fresh Git status before validation showed `main...origin/main` with a clean worktree.
- `npm test` passed `3005/3005` with `0` failures.
- Post-test Git status and diff check remained clean.
- No live `search_memory`, `record_memory`, `memory_overview`, bearer-token use, provider/API, true memory read/write, raw store scan, config/watchdog/startup change, public MCP expansion, remote action, readiness claim, or `RC_READY` claim occurred.

Validation: `CMV-1549` local health validation.

Next safe action:

- Choose an explicit local source/test slice or scoped board task before implementation.
- Live memory/client/provider/runtime gates remain exact-approval boundaries.

## CM-1438 Auth Preflight Envelope Clarification

Status: `COMPLETED_VALIDATED_DOCS_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH_CLARIFICATION_NOT_EXECUTED`

Scope:

```text
docs/source-of-truth clarification; no live execution
```

Recorded:

- Clarification path: `docs/CM1438_AUTHENTICATED_MCP_PREFLIGHT_ENVELOPE_CLARIFICATION.md`.
- Updated packet: `docs/CM1436_SCOPED_WRITE_FOLLOW_UP_SEARCH_VALIDATION_SCOPE_PACKET.md`.
- CM-1437 classified as `SEARCH_SHAPE_PASSED_BUT_BOUNDARY_DEVIATED`.
- CM-1437 sanitized shape evidence was positive: exactly one `search_memory`, `resultCount=1`, `resultsLength=1`, `access.mode=authenticated_bounded_search`, forbidden key paths `0`, no raw/id/path/title/snippet leakage.
- Deviation reason: bearer token was used for authenticated MCP `initialize` session setup, while the approval wording allowed bearer token only for the one `search_memory` call.
- Future authenticated MCP approvals may explicitly allow bearer token use for authenticated `initialize` session setup, authenticated `tools/list` if required, and the exactly approved `tools/call`.
- Extra tool calls, extra search, broad reads, raw response output/persistence, provider/API, raw store scan, memoryId lookup, and readiness / `RC_READY` claims remain forbidden unless separately and exactly approved.
- No live `search_memory`, `record_memory`, `memory_overview`, bearer-token use, provider/API, true memory read/write, raw store scan, memoryId lookup, raw response print/persist, runtime action, public MCP expansion, remote action, or readiness / `RC_READY` claim occurred in CM-1438.

Boundary:

- No new live probe in CM-1438.
- No `record_memory`.
- No `search_memory`.
- No `memory_overview`.
- No provider/API call.
- No bearer-token use in CM-1438.
- No raw memory/audit/store scan.
- No memoryId lookup.
- No raw response print or persistence.
- No durable memory/audit write.
- No config/watchdog/startup change.
- No public MCP expansion.
- No remote action.
- No readiness, reliability, release, cutover, or `RC_READY` claim.

Validation: `CMV-1548` docs/source-of-truth validation.
